# Projects
A collection of projects showcasing my work in AI, Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, and Knowledge Engineering. Includes implementations in Explainable AI, Ontologies, and Cloud Infrastructure Automation.

### ðŸ“Œ Explainable AI for Medical Imaging  
**Description:** Implemented Grad-CAM for pneumonia diagnosis using deep learning.  
**Tech Stack:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas

### ðŸ“Œ Customer Churn Prediction System (End-to-End ML Pipeline with MLOps)  
**Description:** Developed a modular machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn, implementing data ingestion, train-test split, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Used StandardScaler for feature scaling and optimized model performance using F1-score as the key evaluation metric.  
**Tech Stack:** Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, MLflow (for MLOps), Docker (for deployment)
